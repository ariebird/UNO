    <h2>COVID-19 Protocols</h2>
    <p>To ensure safety from the COVID-19 virus, the Mueller Center will do 
       everything in its power to protect RPI students.  Most importantly, 
       the Mueller Center will be operating at reduced capacity to ensure 
       social distancing protocols are being met. A reservation system has been put into 
       place to allow a maximum of 20 students to be using the Mueller Center at one time. 
       Also, students will be expected to wipe down any equipment they use, and all equipment 
       will be cleaned at the beginning and end of each day.
