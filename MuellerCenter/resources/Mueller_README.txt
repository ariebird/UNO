Mueller Center Reservation System README

	All the required files to run the Mueller Center Reservation System 
are contained in the Mueller Center folder. The file must be uploaded to a 
remote server (XAMPP) in order for the Log In, Check In/Out, and Reservation 
functions to work. 

	The web application contains two main functions: making a reservation 
for the Mueller Center and checking in/out of the Mueller Center.  Both of 
these functions are linked to the home page, file name index.html.  When 
clicking on either "Currently at Gym?" or "Make a Reservation" will bring you 
to a Log In page which will prompt you to input your RCSID and password.  
There are three sample users whose log in credentials are contained within a 
JSON file named database.json in the resources folder. The sample users are 
further described in the final project write up.  

	Inputs like a reservation or check in/out will remain in place during 
the session on the web application but will reset once the browser is closed.
